# GoAPICraft
This is a proof of concept (POC) for a RESTful API in Go using Echo, Go Swagger, and Air.

## Installation 
- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (1.21.0)
- [Echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo) 
- [Swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag)
- [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air)

## Install dependencies

```
go get -d ./...
```

## Use
To start the server, you can use Air for hot reloading:
```
air
```
Now you can visit http://localhost:8008/swagger/index.html to see the API documentation generated by Swagger.
